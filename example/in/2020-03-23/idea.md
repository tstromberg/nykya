description: I have a syncing feeling about this
---

## My day job ...

I love hugo for documentation sites, but it felt too much like work for a personal blog.

So, I wrote my own engine with some of my own ideas: nyky√§

## The idea.

* The ability to write posts in Google Docs, and automatically sync it to the blog
* The ability to annotate images in Capture One, and automatically post them to the blog
* The ability to sync tweets in, permanently

## Does it have legs?

*Too early to tell*.
